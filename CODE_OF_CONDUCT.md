# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. This project exists to advance IDEF0 as a valuable methodology for hierarchical system modeling and activity analysis. We welcome engagement, discussion, constructive criticism, and contributions from people of all backgrounds.

## Our Values

This project is built on respect for:

- **IDEF0 methodology**: We recognize IDEF0's genuine utility and value for appropriate applications
- **Intellectual heritage**: KBSI's original work in developing AI0Win and advancing IDEF0 tools is acknowledged and respected
- **Collaborative innovation**: We aim to build upon existing knowledge, not diminish it
- **Diverse perspectives**: Different approaches to problem-solving, including UML and other methodologies, have merit in their appropriate contexts

## Expected Behavior

Participants in this community are expected to:

- **Be respectful**: Treat all participants with courtesy and professionalism
- **Be constructive**: Offer criticism that helps improve the project, not tear it down
- **Be inclusive**: Welcome people of all backgrounds, experience levels, and perspectives
- **Be collaborative**: Work toward shared goals of advancing IDEF0 tooling
- **Be honest**: Acknowledge limitations, uncertainties, and what we don't know

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are unacceptable in this community:

- Speaking ill of KBSI, their work on AI0Win, or their contributions to IDEF0 development
- Disparaging the methodology or work of other projects without constructive purpose
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks based on any characteristic
- Dismissive or condescending language toward contributors or the work of others
- Deliberate disruption of discussions or the development process
- Spreading misinformation about the project's goals or legal status

## Important Legal Context

**Intellectual Property Status**: The legal status of this project relative to KBSI's original work, AI0Win, and the IDEF0 standard remains unclear and potentially contentious. We do not claim ownership of IDEF0, the AI0 format, or any intellectual property that may belong to KBSI or others. This project is offered as-is under the placeholder license provided.

All participants should understand that:
- The IDEF0 standard and its historical development are not our creation
- KBSI's contributions to IDEF0 tooling are recognized and respected
- Any legal issues or IP conflicts should be reported immediately to the maintainers
- This project respects all applicable intellectual property rights

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to:
- All GitHub repositories under this project
- Issue discussions and pull request reviews
- Community discussions and forums
- All project communications

## Enforcement

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior:

1. **Report it**: Contact the maintainers at the repository level
2. **Be specific**: Describe what happened and provide context
3. **Be safe**: Focus on describing behavior, not making assumptions about intent

The maintainers will review reports and determine appropriate action, which may include:
- Private discussion with the participant
- Public clarification of community standards
- Removal of content
- Temporary or permanent removal from the community

Our goal is to maintain a healthy, collaborative environment that respects the intellectual heritage of IDEF0 while building its future.

This code of conduct is a living document. If you have suggestions for improvement or questions about our values, please raise them constructively in a discussion or issue.
